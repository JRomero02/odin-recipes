  <h3>Easy Weekend Summer Time Ribs</h3>
  <p>I made this 6 hour recipe last summer during covid while I was home all day for days at a time.
  These ribs are perfect and fall off the bone when bitting into them. These ribs use a popular 3 2 1 method of cooking ribs.  </p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 rack of St Louis style ribs</li>
    <li>4 Tbsp yellow mustard</li>
    <li>1 cup of apple juice</li>
    <li>BBQ rub of choice(<a href="https://bbqrubs.com/products/killer-hogs-bbq-rub">recommendation)</a></li>
    <li>Slow burning charcoal and Hickory wood chunks.</li>
    <li>BBQ sauce of choice</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Spread yellow mustard evenly over the ribs covering completely. Next, spread the dry rub over the ribs covering completely. </li>
    <li>Prepare your smoker according to manufacture's directions to a heat of 225 F degrees. Once up to temp and light smoke, add you hickory wood chunks. 
      On the opposite end of the coals, I recommend a pan with water and 1/2 a cup of apple juice to keep moister while smoking. </li>
    <li>Place ribs, bone side down, on the smoker and let smoke for 3 hours at 225 degrees F. </li>
    <li>Remove ribs from smoker after 3 hours, Lay tinfoil out on counter (enough to wrap ribs in) and lay the ribs on the foil. Mix 1/2 c. bbq sauce and 1/2 c.
      apple juice together in small bowl. Pour it carefully over the ribs and seal up the foil so nothing leaks out. 
      Place ribs back in the smoker at 225 degrees F for 2 hours.</li>
    <li>After 2 hours has passed remove the ribs from the smoker. Remove the ribs from foil.
      Coat ribs with BBQ sauce and place back on the smoker for 1 hour</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
